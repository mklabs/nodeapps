###  harmony IO

node.js, socket.IO & harmony experiment.

It's kind of buggy, non secure & no perf optimizations. 
    	
Demo: [http://nodeapp.mkl.me](http://nodeapp.mkl.me) (Test with pure socket.IO, we can't proxying websocket requests).

Based on [Harmony](http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/) || [Code](https://github.com/mrdoob/harmony)
